<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">Turn 3 (1986)<br />
<br />
Trouble is brewing, especially with the reinvigoration of Soviet Russia. In your channels with LRU, you’re hearing of them getting double their funding to continue hunting down those beasts. The massive creatures are guarding treasures beneath their nests that can empower entire nations. The Templars are holding fast against the supernatural assault, but they are requesting some of the new weaponry you have developed. The few Chemical Throwers you’ve sent their way have apparently been a godsend, and the Alpha Strikers have piqued their interest.<br />
<br />
CSG has been doing well for themselves, with you supplying weaponry and Steinberg getting air support capability they’ve identified a few smuggling rings heading towards Europe and smashed them apart in the nick of time. Apparently Major Steinberg has reported that he is incapable of housing any more soldiers for the time being, and so the Veterans will be going to you this year. <br />
<br />
Your progress is pleasing, especially in terms of development of weaponry. Though your combat was barely passable in the review (Ha!) they’ve decided to once more equally halve the budget between you and your counterpart. Federal Income 250, Units Bought this turn start at Veteran (+2 to All Stats)<br />
<br />
 You’re making nearly quadruple what they’re giving you in trade and in patents. In all honesty you could care less about their money.<br />
<br />
Still, the situation in China is worrying... it makes you feel powerless to be honest, sending anyone there would be practically be suicide. <br />
<br />
605 Income Available.<br />
<br />
You’ll have to make sure it never happens again.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Learning</u></b>: It’s odd to think that Rachel Timothy is now the age when you had met her. At 21, she still seems childlike, and if anything her drive to progress technology has not faltered in the slightest. No small amount of thanks towards you comes from her, for allowing her to shape the future in both warfare and in normal society. <b>(Choose 2)</b><br />
<br />
<b> [X] Communications</b>: Radios are too bulky, especially the kind that will allow you to converse with a squad half-way across the country. Mobile Phone Companies have been set up in Japan and in several Nordic Countries in Europe. However, not having a call center can be rectified by using a specialized computer… Ms. Timothy insists on creating a transmitter based for computers, similar to radio, but only receivable by computers. You simply have to have them in sets and… The science behind it is new, but with your computational devices you’re sure you can figure it out quickly!  Cost: 100 Upkeep: 50 Chance of Success 80%  Time: 1 Year. Reward: Can Order Squads from Base, Squads Coordinate Easier. Minimum +100 Research Income on completion.<br />
<br />
Roll: 28 +10 = 38: Required: 20: Success<br />
<br />
This very nearly fails, probably because of the timetable you’ve set, but seeing its importance made you want it eagerly. The machine is reliable, but takes a bigger investment than you previously invested for that fact. However, besides the small increase in cost of the devices, you’ve created a series of transmitters that effectively allow you to stay in communication with your troops wherever they might be in the world. Most of the cost is actually the need for you to keep spreading your reliable transmitters wherever you might need them.<br />
<br />
Looking over it, the government is hesitant to invest in it mainly for the large cost, but you find many, many buyers among the rich and wealthy. The cordless phone systems are going to be inaccessible for the lower and middle class, where most of a profit is made, but that merely gives you an excuse to research more in this direction, and subsequently make a better, cheaper, and more reliable product for the masses.<br />
</span><br />
<b><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">Rewards: +100 Research Income, Improved Communications (Cannot be listened on) Can give orders to troops from HQ. Rolls to develop. +5 Upkeep (55 Total).</span></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 0.938rem"><br />
<b>[X] Improved Body Armor</b>: Given the fact that Rune Armor is proving to simply be better than any modern armor available, the government wants you in on the development of the new generation of body armor. It’s no small secret that all your innovations are generally being adopted by the US military, but this monumental program is the first sign they’re truly not considering you lightly. Cost: 150. Upkeep:0 (Federal Program, Won’t Require any money for you to Upkeep). Time: 2 Years. Chance of Success 90% Reward: Enhanced Infantry Armor (Adds to Squad Cost), Improved Defense (Minimum 1, Maximum 3) +150 Research Income on completion<br />
<br />
Roll: 82 +10 = 92<br />
<br />
This project goes ridiculously well, you and Ms. Timothy practically send others vying for the opportunity running home. Your proposal for a modular armor based on a long-coat design blows everything else out of the water. Whatever new materials that might be developed can simply be fitted into slots, the material composition is weatherproof and light, yet it provides better protection against explosives, overwhelming force, and attacks using bladed or pointed weapons. It’s even protective against biting attacks, and can be completely sealed around the legs with proper modifications.<br />
<br />
The armor is easier to produce as well, given that you and Miss Timothy utilize the computer to create a thread mesh that reduces the amount of required Kevlar yet still provides the protection of your next best competitor, if not more.<br />
<br />
The fact that you’ve come up with multiple attachments to quickly allow for your body armor to be changed according to the environment and current warzone is merely a bonus.<br />
<br />
If there was a way to speed up the retooling of factories, you’ll already have your men clad in them… along with just about every other soldier in the United States Infantry.<br />
</span><br />
<b><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">Rewards: +3 Defense to Base Units (No need to pay Extra), +200 Extra Research Income, Finishes next year.</span></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 0.938rem"><br />
<b><u>Personal</u></b>: You feel… more calm than you’ve ever been your entire life. Despite the fact the state of the world is rapidly deteriorating, you can honestly say that you sleep well at night knowing you’ve done the extent of what you can do every day.  Given the reports from your fellow organization heads, you feel pained to know you’re the only one not stressed. <b>(Choose 2)</b><br />
<br />
<b> [X] Master Glyphs and Greater Circle Magic</b>: You’re undoubtedly the most powerful, human magic-user in North America, perhaps even the world. The fact that you don’t know anything but a few tricks… is disappointing. Considering what you’re fighting against, learning how to use magic and learning on how to apply some of the more esoteric Runes would be a good boon for you. Cost: 0 Upkeep:0 Time 1 Year. Chance of Success: 100% Reward: Trait: Magical Arsenal: 1/2 of Piety added onto Martial. Score 50 or Greater: gain Great Coat of Greater Protection Against Miscellaneous Things (Protects against all environmental effects and defense against Monsters of Normal Strength.)<br />
<br />
Roll: 100: Critical Roll: 93 <br />
<br />
You astound yourself, and perhaps even scare yourself a little bit.<br />
<br />
The amount of power you have at your disposal… is simply terrifying, especially when you take into account the fact you seem to be capable of utilizing more Circles at any time than anyone else on the base. To put it into perspective Barth Allen can call forth about 5 low-ranked circles, 3 mid-ranked, and 1 high-ranked circle at any given time. A high ranked circle’s firepower is just shy of that of a missile, depending mostly on what element is used as output. <br />
<br />
You can call forth four times his number of circles, and quickly reform them to fire again and again and again…<br />
<br />
Theoretically, it would take four Artillery Mage <i>squads </i>to keep up with your firepower, and even then they can’t last nearly as long as you can. What effectively limits you in regards to your firepower, is that you don’t have an Ultra-Ranked Circle constructed to make the full use of your abilities.<br />
<br />
Then, you begin to construct your means of protection in the event of battle and you blow past anything Barnes Walker ever managed. You get everything you aimed for in regards to protection, but there is just something about it that… meshes perfectly. The Great Coat of Greater Protection Against Miscellaneous Things withstood the firepower of an Alpha Strike without a single thread out of place. Even radiation doesn’t pass through it, and you weren’t even trying to get that particular protection!<br />
<br />
Then, to your surprise, after exhausting yourself magically day after day of practicing and crafting a magical coat that’ll probably survive a low-yield nuclear blast… you find yourself <i>stronger.</i><br />
</span><br />
<b><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">Rewards: </span></b><br />
<br />
<b><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">Trait: Greater Magical Arsenal: 2/3’s of Piety Added onto Martial Score.</span></b><br />

<b><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">Great Coat of Greater Protection Against Miscellaneous Things: Protects against all environmental effects, can only be damaged by monsters of High strength, and grants 1 re-roll in combat situations.</span></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 0.938rem"><br />
<b> [X] Getting to Know Them</b>: Your counterparts are: Alexandra Daryna, Christopher Saint and Roderick Steinberg. Telling them of your plans certainly won’t hurt, making sure they’re not going to off themselves from stress is what you’re truly aiming for. Cost:10 Upkeep:0 Time 1 Year. Chance of Success: 85% Reward: Teach Meditation to other leaders, reduce their stress levels, increase relations with other leaders.<br />
<br />
Roll: 92: Success<br />
<br />
Your fellows take to your advice like fish to water, and they all completely agree to your suggestion that your branch will remain secret. Officially, it’ll be so that CSG will be the only American Supernatural Organization. Unofficially, you’re going to be taking to the shadows in what is already supposed to be a shadow war. Focus on R and D will be on you, and they’ll make sure to inform you of anything large that is occurring, so long as you make sure that you do the same.<br />
<br />
To say they’re surprised by your spy network is putting it lightly. They hadn’t even known all of the Three Factions were so <i>mobilized </i>in the matters concerning Asia, let alone actually known that Asia was ruled entirely by vampires.<br />

<div class="bbWrapper">Yeah, but in our previous quests our protagonist was this heroic type and their sheer power disrupted the setting a bit. Sheridan is... different.<br />
<br />
Here, we&#039;re supposed to stick to the shadows and displaying our power openly is contraindicated. Honestly, Sheridan kind of reminds me of that bullshit human antagonist heading the shadowy immoral &#039;Magiical CIA&#039; equivalent that you see crop up in the monster girl harem anime every once in awhile. There were all these rules and guidelines and explanations at the start of the show about how humans can&#039;t actually challenge any of the Three Great Factions, and yet somehow in season three when the original bad guys are defeated his shadowy organization discovered these weapons that actually make them a threat despite no human managing in the centuries beforehand. Because &#039;lol computers&#039;.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s no good reason for this antagonist to actually have risen to become head of the shadowy organization rather than be a field agent where he can make full use of his ability, and he&#039;s inexplicably more powerful than any other human in the setting, seemingly <i>just </i>to match the heroic protagonist&#039;s bullshit. And somehow these crazily diverse groups like the magical US Army and the magical KGB and the Knights Templar and so on all trust him to handle their research and run their espionage units and basically hand him ultimate power because &#039;he&#039;s very charismatic&#039;.<br />
<br />
Seriously, Sheridan is<i> that guy</i>. He&#039;s like designed to be a harem anime villain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that I have unlocked the secret of Woden&#039;s Blood... NOTHING will stop CORE from exterminating all those who oppose humanity&#039;s domination of the earth! MWAHAHAHA!&quot;</div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">Rumor Mill (Turn 3)<br />
<br />
<b>Shattered Jade: </b>The reason behind the stirring of the Ancient Jade empire has revealed itself: the Jing Dan, the Immortal Emperor has been killed by one of his daughters. The immense country is in the tumults of a massive civil war, with the minor factions that were once afraid now hovering around the country like crows. Vampires, always impressive in terms of magical ability, are fleeing China in droves and being taken in by the Three Factions. Your men have verified that the Devils and Angels are using some sort of system to turn creatures into their own kind, though the Angels seem to be more picky of whom they choose and they don’t seem to fully become angels... could it be God is gathering strength and thus relegating the task of expanding the Heavenly Host to the Angels themselves? Nevertheless, the perils of civil war provide unique opportunities… mainly to acquire some refugees and some ancient artifacts.<br />
<br />
<b>Alliance Bound In Bloodstained Snow: </b>The massive chimeric beasts of Russia have begun to travel in packs and roam their territories. The demi-human clans of Russia have allied with the human organization that killed the last Chimeric Beast, just a year ago. Though it is clear the trust is uneasy and both sides are greatly angered at one another, the humans are providing a clear advantage to the demi-human clans in providing mass-produced runic weaponry. The existence of such weapons are a surprise to all factions, whether minor or major, as the beast clans are quickly tearing into the massive creatures while armed with their new, powerful weaponry. The massive deposits located in the various territories are quickly being divided up in terms of wealth… it seems that the fear of the Cold War extending will ring true, as the influx of wealth has begun to grease the cogs of the Soviet Nation once more. <br />
<br />
<b>Crossing Swords: </b>The Templar, composed of all the minor human factions of Europe, have created the Caliburn Holy Sword Set and thus earned themselves another enemy. A small fleet of magical vessels have been assembled by the Church to take the Templar’s fortified stronghold, manned by Knights Hospitaller, a premier, professional army armed with weapons enchanted by light,  and accompanied by two wielders of the Excalibur. The declaration of their intention is to demand the destruction of the Seven ‘Heretical’ Swords from the Templars, and to do such a thing themselves if the demands are not met. Though they have recently begun to receive supplies and modern weaponry from the modern world, many express doubts of their ability to survive the coming Armada of Faith while still beleaguered by their current opponents. <br />
<br />
<b>Longinus Rising: </b>The last sighting of the Sacred Gear used to kill Christ was over four hundred years ago, the spear being used to kill the last Lucifer before it and its user was killed in battle by the Devils. Found by a warlord in Africa, the wielder was of a tribe that the warlord sent his forces to  attack. The third-world army, accompanied by several attack helicopters, was wiped out to the last man more than a kilometer away from the village. The spear, deadly against any foe and granting its wielder a shield that can shrug off most attacks, seems to still be in untrained hands given that it only struck from the current dimension instead of using its dimensional distortion effect to attack from multiple angles and different dimensions…<br />
<br />
<b>Shock and Awe: </b>Introducing itself to the world, the CSG of America has proven itself to be the source of the military technology advancement in a stunning, systematic sweep of all the major cities in America. They accrued many casualties and the mission was left uncompleted due to the fact many vagrants fled instead of risking battle, but the many victories were stunning and have drawn the attention of many downtrodden clans within America. As expected, the many minor races within America petitioned for aid in exchange for wealth and their offer was accepted. Perhaps for the first time since the country’s founding, Vagrants will no longer have free reign to come and do as they please without fear of reprisal. Still, many of the Major Factions note that the Vagrants will most likely band together and create perhaps the largest conglomeration of minor races to ever be seen, in order to counter the military-styled opponent they now face.<br />
<br />
<b>Computers in Hell: </b>Through the innovation of several prominent devils, computers are now able to be taken into hell without being fear of suddenly destroying themselves. The demand for the new device is skyrocketing…</span></div>

<br />
[You are currently Injured (-2 Martial) this trait will be gone by the end of the year.]<br />
<br />
The current situation is… rather grave.<br />
<br />
In Russia, they are mounting a massive counter-offensive with demi-humans supported by as much armor that can be brought to bear. Still, it’s only a stopgap measure as even though the giant chimera are being driven off and wounded, they aren’t being killed. The beasts are very intelligent and very knowledgeable of their finite numbers, thus they are willing to take wounds in order to make sure they all stay alive. The situation can only stand for another year before the demi-humans will have their entire force injured or otherwise unable to battle and then be replaced by human soldiers, which would only result in massacres. They need help, and has requested you to locate a pack of six chimeric beasts that are ferrying around the child-beasts and several eggs. Then, the group will be nuked.<br />
<br />
Over in Europe the Church is being a bunch of idiots, but the Templars simply cannot destroy their Seven Holy Swords. The blades are still needed in order to properly destroy the enemy currently haranguing them at their base. Their request from you is simpler: delay the armada by a year. No small feat considering the magical nature of the ships and the experienced men and women that compromise the Knights Hospitaller. However, you do have the advantage of having a very, very good possible distraction on your side that is already aligned with the Templars and ought to be able to give your men enough time to devastate the fleet.<br />
<br />
Congress has approved a larger budget for your two groups, but most of the increase will be going to CSG for the sole reason that the man is currently fighting a war on American soil. Much to your surprise, he’s the only ally of yours that doesn’t outright need your help. The man’s refurbished a few cargo-planes into slapdash gunships and acquired a few jet fighters to field for his fight.  Of course, the man himself didn’t tell you this, but rather his wife Maria Arce did. The woman is from South America and is quite attractive, but is more cunning than a snake. You’re better, of course, but the woman’s going to make it a lot harder for you to manipulate her husband. All for the better really, because if a matter of manipulation is difficult for you, it’ll be nigh-impossible for others.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Major Steinberg will require most of the manpower for his campaign, leaving you with less-skilled special forces to pick from. What a tragedy.<br />
</span><br />
<b><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">Federal Income: 300, Units Bought This Turn Will Be at Experienced: +1 to All Stats.</span></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 0.938rem"><br />
Also you’ve realized that you can blow away a main battle tank in less than five seconds, a bit scary considering you still can’t handle yourself in a fistfight.<br />
</span><br />
<b><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">1270 Income Available</span></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 0.938rem"><br />
…<br />
<br />
<b><u>Martial:</u></b> Elena Heart is running about and undermining Dietrich’s authority… and he’s not doing a thing about it. As it stands the woman is apparently doing half his job for him and the men are terrified of her more than him. They’re being put through their paces, and he can actually make things go smoother than it used to. (Choose 1) [Currently have Six Squads, Can Have Thirty Four More]<br />
<br />
Unit Ranking Chart (‘Ranking’ 1 (Negligible Effect) to 20 (Extremely Effective))<br />
<br />
<b>[] Recruitment  Drive</b>: All you have at the moment are two rifleman squads, granted they’re one of the best squads of riflemen in the world, they’re still just two squads! They’re going to need numbers to face their enemies! Once more you’ve expanded your training repertoire, you’re going to need them after all. Cost: 165  (27.5 Per Squad) Upkeep 30 Time: 1 Year. Reward: 6 Rifleman Squads (Experienced: Grants +1 to all Unit Rankings)<br />
<br />
Base Rifleman: (Attack: 2, Armor 1, Mobility 2, Evasion: 2)<br />
<br />
<b>[] Agent Squads Training</b>: Agents are the best of what you have and the best at what they do. Where your normal squads solve things with firepower, four of these guys are supposedly able to do the work of a dozen rifleman squads while keeping quiet. So far you have only one of them, but if CSG’s mission is to go by you’ll need more! Cost: 120 (40 Per Agent Squad) Upkeep: 30. Time: 1 Year. Reward: 3 Agent Squads. (Veteran: Grants +2 to all Unit Rankings)<br />
<br />
Base Agent Squad: (Attack 6 , Defense 1, Mobility 4, Evasion: 4)<br />
<br />
<b>[] Double Trouble</b>: Two Attack Helicopters, another transport helicopter, and Two Agent Squads. If you’re going to be culling Vagrants every year, you might as well have a dedicated, powerful task force to use for it, that you can also use for… other things?  You have no clue what you else you can do with this amount of firepower. Cost 80 (Agents) 200 (Attack Helicopters) 40 (Military Transport Helicopter): All Infantry Squads. Upkeep: 110. Time: 1 Year. Reward: 2 Attack Helicopters, 2 Agent Squads, 1 Military Transport.<br />
<br />
<b>[] Giants in Russia</b>: Chimeric Beasts are gigantic, fast, and very, very stealthy. Any attempt to follow them by plane is met with disaster and LRU’s men aren’t nearly maneuverable enough to venture out  with the slightest chance of success. However, at your disposal are several teams quite well-versed in jungle movement and with very, very good gear to keep them out of trouble. Also, you have your new communicators to help them out. They’ll get the Chimera Pack sighted in for nuclear strikes in no time flat. Cost: 2 Agent Squads Chance of Success: 70%: Time: 1 Year. Reward: LRU relations increase, substantial gain in war against Chimeric Beasts. 2 Agent Squads Gain Experience (Higher Experienced Ones Get Priority)<br />
<br />
<b><u>Stewardship</u></b>: Baker Leslie has taken the Elena Heart with aplomb, quite approving of her ‘sensibilities’. The Dhamphir doesn’t do much besides organize things, but organization is key to success in terms of business and economy. The man is obviously looking towards you to keeping the woman on staff through any means necessary. Truly, the southern states have such odd traditions...  (Choose 1)<br />
<br />
<b>[] Drumming Up Coffers</b>: Tycoon Schmoozing: Racist and bigoted he might be, but Mr. Leslie knows a lot of other racists and bigots all too willing to lend a fair bit of money to your cause. Spending money to make money is normal, but the cost of doing an all-around trip drumming up pockets of the rich is downright ridiculous. Still, the payoff will be worth it. Cost: 100 Chance of Success: 80%: Time: 1 Year. Reward: 150 Income<br />
<br />
<b>[] Vehicle Service Center</b>: Another massive project, who would’ve thought! This time you’re going to make a series of warehouses and depots for a vehicle production and maintenance center. After building these, you ought to be able to field them quickly with your growing air fleet. Cost: 180 -10 (CSG Spare Parts) = 170. Upkeep 90. Time Cost: 1 Year. Reward: Unlocks Armored Vehicles, Vehicle Creation.<br />
<br />
<b>[] Manufacturing Center Expansion</b>: The computer factory will finish this year, but according to Mr. Leslie the popularity of the computer isn’t to be underestimated. The plans he has put forward have been seen through by Timothy, despite the fact he dislikes her he cannot deny that she is the resident expert in the theories surrounding the computers. Anyway, the old man wants to see the business flourish and your computers keep advancing by leaps and bounds. Cost: 200 Upkeep: 100 Chance of Success: 80%: Time: 2 Years. Reward: +450 Income, Better Computers.</span></div>

<b>Thankfully, any points above twenty is a wholly different ballgame than those below.<br />

1-20 = 5 Points for Each &#039;Skill&#039; in other AGG games but in categories.<br />
<br />
For Example: <br />
<br />
Martial 5 = Melee Weapons: Swords: 25<br />
<br />
But 21-30 (Which are harder to get) = 10 Points Each.<br />
<br />
Martial 25 = Melee Weapons: Swords: 150<br />

<br />
[You are currently Injured (-2 Martial) this trait will be gone by the end of the year.]<br />
<br />
The current situation is… rather grave.<br />
<br />
In Russia, they are mounting a massive counter-offensive with demi-humans supported by as much armor that can be brought to bear. Still, it’s only a stopgap measure as even though the giant chimera are being driven off and wounded, they aren’t being killed. The beasts are very intelligent and very knowledgeable of their finite numbers, thus they are willing to take wounds in order to make sure they all stay alive. The situation can only stand for another year before the demi-humans will have their entire force injured or otherwise unable to battle and then be replaced by human soldiers, which would only result in massacres. They need help, and has requested you to locate a pack of six chimeric beasts that are ferrying around the child-beasts and several eggs. Then, the group will be nuked.<br />
<br />
Over in Europe the Church is being a bunch of idiots, but the Templars simply cannot destroy their Seven Holy Swords. The blades are still needed in order to properly destroy the enemy currently haranguing them at their base. Their request from you is simpler: delay the armada by a year. No small feat considering the magical nature of the ships and the experienced men and women that compromise the Knights Hospitaller. However, you do have the advantage of having a very, very good possible distraction on your side that is already aligned with the Templars and ought to be able to give your men enough time to devastate the fleet.<br />
<br />
Congress has approved a larger budget for your two groups, but most of the increase will be going to CSG for the sole reason that the man is currently fighting a war on American soil. Much to your surprise, he’s the only ally of yours that doesn’t outright need your help. The man’s refurbished a few cargo-planes into slapdash gunships and acquired a few jet fighters to field for his fight.  Of course, the man himself didn’t tell you this, but rather his wife Maria Arce did. The woman is from South America and is quite attractive, but is more cunning than a snake. You’re better, of course, but the woman’s going to make it a lot harder for you to manipulate her husband. All for the better really, because if a matter of manipulation is difficult for you, it’ll be nigh-impossible for others.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Major Steinberg will require most of the manpower for his campaign, leaving you with less-skilled special forces to pick from. What a tragedy.<br />

<b>[X] Giants in Russia</b>: Chimeric Beasts are gigantic, fast, and very, very stealthy. Any attempt to follow them by plane is met with disaster and LRU’s men aren’t nearly maneuverable enough to venture out  with the slightest chance of success. However, at your disposal are several teams quite well-versed in jungle movement and with very, very good gear to keep them out of trouble. Also, you have your new communicators to help them out. They’ll get the Chimera Pack sighted in for nuclear strikes in no time flat. Cost: 2 Agent Squads Chance of Success: 70%: Time: 1 Year.

<br />
Even though the leader of the humans said the ones that came were just humans of another country, the moment I laid my eyes upon them I knew the woman was lying.<br />
<br />
The men that came kept to themselves, clad in cloaks covered in basic runes and odd contraptions that allowed them to move about quickly with shooting ropes. The weapons they carried were different as well and were obviously not the flimsy guns used by the armies of the ‘Soviet Union’. There were always tubes on their backs that they carried with great care, probably similar to the launchers of explosives that our allies used.<br />
<br />
They carried about themselves with pride and treated me and my clan with respect, unlike the normal soldiers fielded by the human woman. They could only cower in fear, especially when we left our ancestry  unhidden. The humans from across the ocean were cautious, but they met our greetings firmly with their strange customs.<br />
<br />
The men moved quickly and quietly, as I guided them into the forest to search for our quarry. They were skilled and had some form of communication that did not rely on magic. They introduced me to the ‘transmitter phone’ the first night in the wilderness, beneath a tarp with a fresh kill shared amongst us. I did not know whether I was more astounded by the advances in technology or their extensive skills in all manner of things. Overtime, I became jealous of the machines they wore to quickly traverse the forest.<br />
<br />
They were hunters, undoubtedly, and though I never saw their faces in the year-long mission, the group was comfortable to stay within, more so than with the other humans. The few times we returned to the base of operations from the wilderness, I had to remind myself how other humans acted in my presence, so used to their presence I was. <br />
<br />
We found the creatures faster than anticipated, both because of their greater speed and experience, but also how well they worked with me. They were fine troops to lead, and even though I led them I was taught how to lead better.<br />
<br />
Then as we were about to call in the location of the mother pack… disaster struck.<br />
<br />
Four vagrant devils, preaching about the sanctity of life and that such creatures needed to be protected… they struck against us from the shadows. They focused first on me immediately, their hands raising to exact magic upon my form and destroy me before I could put forth my greater physical abilities.<br />
<br />
Four brought forth their weapons as the others launched themselves, they knew of the deadliness of their foes and brutally brought the first attacker low with combined might. One moment the  exiled devil was flying in the air the next he was perforated by hooks and brought to the ground, where they were upon him like wolves, trapping him in a second, and then firing their  launchers in unison at their trapped target. <br />
<br />
 The immortal creature’s body parts did not even finish falling before they were upon the next, casting the simplest of magics to harry their opponents and disrupt their attention.<br />
<br />
I slayed only one devil that day.<br />
<br />
The bombs were dropped and the precious cargo of the beasts were destroyed, and the wounded ones slain. I joined my compatriots in the felling of the beasts.<br />
<br />
Upon my return all my companions were gone, though instrumental in the great victory, they left instead of joining in on the celebration. <br />
<br />
I was lauded as the lone ‘hero’ who found the mother pack and slayed four exiled devils with my own power. <br />
<br />
The victory was hollow for me, until I found a manual and one of the machines I had wanted placed atop my bedding with a letter of instruction regarding the keeping of secrets from the head of my clan…<br />

<b><u>Stewardship</u></b>: Baker Leslie has taken the Elena Heart with aplomb, quite approving of her ‘sensibilities’.

Anyway, the old man wants to see the business flourish and your computers keep advancing by leaps and bounds. Cost: 200 Upkeep: 100 Chance of Success: 80%: Time: 2 Years. Reward: +450 Income, Better Computers.<br />
<br />
Rolled: 45: Success<br />
<br />
The entire matter concerning the massive production of the computers is manpower… you simply cannot hide the construction, the building, or the shipments you are setting up. <br />
<br />
So you don’t hide it, you make it so that your ‘business’ is setting a massive new factory in Arizona, near Las Vegas. It is easy to get ahold of the governor, and even easier to arrange tax-write-offs. You make it seem like you’re heading to Vegas because a sudden bill passing in the state regarding benefits for production of new technologies. Quite a few other entrepreneurs follow your lead, transforming the stretch of land into something being called the ‘Silicon City’, in allusion to the ‘City of Sin’ nearby.<br />
<br />
While you’ll still have to pay full price for the production of the manufacturing center, and it’ll still be a lengthy period of time before it is completed, the ‘bills’ you get passed through your connections to the federal government allow you to spend less in Upkeep and raise your income substantially.<br />

Secondly who is the current Grandmaster of the Knight&#039;s Hospitaller? Because much like John Paul ll above I cannot see Andrew Bertie agreeing to do this.

[You are currently Injured (-2 Martial) this trait will be gone by the end of the year.]<br />
<br />
The current situation is… rather grave.<br />
<br />
In Russia, they are mounting a massive counter-offensive with demi-humans supported by as much armor that can be brought to bear. Still, it’s only a stopgap measure as even though the giant chimera are being driven off and wounded, they aren’t being killed. The beasts are very intelligent and very knowledgeable of their finite numbers, thus they are willing to take wounds in order to make sure they all stay alive. The situation can only stand for another year before the demi-humans will have their entire force injured or otherwise unable to battle and then be replaced by human soldiers, which would only result in massacres. They need help, and has requested you to locate a pack of six chimeric beasts that are ferrying around the child-beasts and several eggs. Then, the group will be nuked.<br />
<br />
Over in Europe the Church is being a bunch of idiots, but the Templars simply cannot destroy their Seven Holy Swords. The blades are still needed in order to properly destroy the enemy currently haranguing them at their base. Their request from you is simpler: delay the armada by a year. No small feat considering the magical nature of the ships and the experienced men and women that compromise the Knights Hospitaller. However, you do have the advantage of having a very, very good possible distraction on your side that is already aligned with the Templars and ought to be able to give your men enough time to devastate the fleet.<br />
<br />
Congress has approved a larger budget for your two groups, but most of the increase will be going to CSG for the sole reason that the man is currently fighting a war on American soil. Much to your surprise, he’s the only ally of yours that doesn’t outright need your help. The man’s refurbished a few cargo-planes into slapdash gunships and acquired a few jet fighters to field for his fight.  Of course, the man himself didn’t tell you this, but rather his wife Maria Arce did. The woman is from South America and is quite attractive, but is more cunning than a snake. You’re better, of course, but the woman’s going to make it a lot harder for you to manipulate her husband. All for the better really, because if a matter of manipulation is difficult for you, it’ll be nigh-impossible for others.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Major Steinberg will require most of the manpower for his campaign, leaving you with less-skilled special forces to pick from. What a tragedy.<br />

<b><u>Diplomacy</u></b>: You’re at the head of the Diplomacy Department. You’ve got a lot of things to manage now, and some things are technically not even ‘Diplomacy’, but just short of espionage and international crime. Well, words have power, money has weight, and you can throw both about with ease. Also Heart is watching and staring at you while you work, you’re convinced she’s trying to better herself in terms of her manners…. You’re sure it’ll take a lifetime of work on her part.

<br />
<b>[] Deep Winter</b>: You’ve found yourself in the enviable position of having a few workable assets in the Soviet Union. Much to your surprise there is a massive amount of corruption going about in their government, with more than a few ‘patriots’ living quite good lives in spite of the deteriorating economy. You can… help… the people your counterpart points out are actually ‘good’. Perhaps this will ease the building tension, and even if that is not achieved, if you try Daryna promises compensation in the form of schematics for Runic Factories.  Cost: 100 Upkeep: 100.

<b>[] It’s Just Business</b>: You’ve been getting overtures from the Devil situated in Los Angeles, and honestly you’re impressed with her business etiquette. ’18 Fleets’ is the name her company goes by, and is primarily in shipping and delivery on a global scale.

Well, not a quick buck, it’s grossly expensive… but you’re not sending Heart or your agents out without some oversight by someone who knows espionage like the back of her hand.  Cost: 250  Upkeep: 0.

Hmmm… there are quite a few warlords in Africa… perhaps you can get into his good graces by offering him money to destroy them? There’s also the matter of a massive fleet that is well within his range… the Templars could use someone like him on their side too… yes, a plan like this might be extravagant, but you’re confident in your ability to manipulate/convince people.

<br />
[You are currently Injured (-2 Martial) this trait will be gone by the end of the year.]<br />
<br />
The current situation is… rather grave.<br />
<br />
In Russia, they are mounting a massive counter-offensive with demi-humans supported by as much armor that can be brought to bear. Still, it’s only a stopgap measure as even though the giant chimera are being driven off and wounded, they aren’t being killed. The beasts are very intelligent and very knowledgeable of their finite numbers, thus they are willing to take wounds in order to make sure they all stay alive. The situation can only stand for another year before the demi-humans will have their entire force injured or otherwise unable to battle and then be replaced by human soldiers, which would only result in massacres. They need help, and has requested you to locate a pack of six chimeric beasts that are ferrying around the child-beasts and several eggs. Then, the group will be nuked.<br />
<br />
Over in Europe the Church is being a bunch of idiots, but the Templars simply cannot destroy their Seven Holy Swords. The blades are still needed in order to properly destroy the enemy currently haranguing them at their base. Their request from you is simpler: delay the armada by a year. No small feat considering the magical nature of the ships and the experienced men and women that compromise the Knights Hospitaller. However, you do have the advantage of having a very, very good possible distraction on your side that is already aligned with the Templars and ought to be able to give your men enough time to devastate the fleet.<br />
<br />
Congress has approved a larger budget for your two groups, but most of the increase will be going to CSG for the sole reason that the man is currently fighting a war on American soil. Much to your surprise, he’s the only ally of yours that doesn’t outright need your help. The man’s refurbished a few cargo-planes into slapdash gunships and acquired a few jet fighters to field for his fight.  Of course, the man himself didn’t tell you this, but rather his wife Maria Arce did. The woman is from South America and is quite attractive, but is more cunning than a snake. You’re better, of course, but the woman’s going to make it a lot harder for you to manipulate her husband. All for the better really, because if a matter of manipulation is difficult for you, it’ll be nigh-impossible for others.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Major Steinberg will require most of the manpower for his campaign, leaving you with less-skilled special forces to pick from. What a tragedy.<br />
</span><br />

<b><u>Diplomacy</u></b>: You’re at the head of the Diplomacy Department.

Well, words have power, money has weight, and you can throw both about with ease. Also Heart is watching and staring at you while you work, you’re convinced she’s trying to better herself in terms of her manners…. You’re sure it’ll take a lifetime of work on her part.

<b>[X] It’s Safe Over Here!:</b> Though Steinberg is doing a good job of attracting attention to him, various minor factions have been ousted from their homes or outright destroyed by the gathering forces of vagrants.

Roll: 19: Required: 20: Partial Success<br />
<br />
You did way too good of a job in this regard. Such a good job that it’s somewhat of a failure.<br />
<br />
On one hand, saving refugees and keeping the minor factions alive did work out. They have shelters, the CSG is reporting that they’re getting overtures from a few clans, and the enemy isn’t finding out where everyone you’re saving is going.<br />
<br />
The only problem, is you don’t either.<br />
<br />
Essentially, the many people you’ve convinced to harbor the refugees took it upon themselves to hide as well as they possibly can, and though you tried to find them, the fact you made it so they have no trails connecting to them… made it damn near impossible to find them. You’re getting budget reports and all that, and drop-off points are  regularly emptied… but everyone you’ve employed is hiding too damned well!<br />
<br />
They’re out there surviving, but you’re not getting any of the information you want! It’s maddening to think that you’ve managed to inspire people to create a massive underground railroad that you yourself have no access to!<br />
<br />
Well, at least by the end of the year you start getting information, but that’s only because you finally managed to convince everyone to attend a meeting and take some transmitters with them.<br />

<br />
A man came in a nice car to meet with my father today.<br />
<br />
The man was very polite and spoke kindly, he wasn’t like the other foreign, pale skinned men. He even spoke in our language, instead of forcing us to speak in his. There was always a light smile on his face.<br />
<br />
He used a cane to walk around the village while his men in a truck unpacked food.<br />
<br />
It was a tithe, according to the custom of my tribe. Many gathered to watch it piled onto the center of the village. It was a tithe worthy of legend, a recognition of our superior strength… and their wish to use that strength.<br />
<br />
My strength.<br />
<br />
My village was small. Too many fights with men of our own country, who wanted our land and my little siblings. Most of our men died in battle and until my spear came to life we were looking for a tribe to join. <br />
<br />
I am of the last ten men in our tribe of sixty, the rest are but women and children.<br />
<br />
The tithe I saw would let us live well, but if this stranger knew of our customs, he must know that he must give me tithes every full moon for my continued service and that we must be provided with things that we had in short supply.<br />
<br />
I could only hope my father saw reason, because if he did not I will have to take the mantle of chief sooner than I wished to…<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
The Longinus user is successfully recruited to cleanse the surrounding area of his home, harass the Armada of the Holy Host, and join the Templars for continued training on his part. The young man is about ten years younger than you, and you’re quite glad to have met him yourself. He’s intelligent, if a tad reckless, but his heart is in the right place and he has a solid read on what’s good and evil.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the look on Saint’s face when you  drop the boy off at Gibraltar is priceless.<br />

<br />
Ms. Thomas doesn’t just make you an underground base, she makes an underground command center, underground tunnels, and underground lanes for deliveries. The work is extensive and well-planned out for future expansions. The mining contractors are kept quiet by you telling them exactly what was happening and not a single one believing you until you ‘confess’ that you’re practicing for the creation of an amusement park where you don’t want any of the staff to ever be seen.<br />
<br />
A small modification to create dust storms is theorized and prepared for. When you finally get a power source for it, you ought to be able to create an artificial dust cloud to cover your base from prying eyes. <br />
<br />
Beyond the extensive underground, the camouflage  is successfully set up and quite a few runes make their way onto the thin tarps. Though they are only made of fabric, they are quite strong and malleable thanks to several practice projects by Barnes’ students. It’ll take quite a bit of force to destroy your aerial cover, especially as you can bring them down to allow defenders to fire back, before lifting them again.<br />
<br />
The cleaner teams are successfully implemented as well and many are spread throughout the United States and military installations around the world with the ability to equip and send them out. They’re not only going to be in your use, which is somewhat worrying, but so long as you don’t make any grievous errors there won’t be a problem concerning your organization being found.<br />

Your magus academy reminds you quite a bit of a university on the inside, despite the fact the outside is more akin to a bunker than any other building. The block of reinforced concrete is an entrance to the underground building where magical research and training will be conducted. Many of the men staffing the place were but normal people a year ago, but now mystic powers and the unknowns of the world are theirs to peruse and manipulate.<br />
<br />
Quite a few of them have, much to their teacher’s consternation, taken the short time after their graduation to attempt to make a spell array for you that doesn’t explode at your full power.<br />
<br />
Didn’t work, but you appreciate their thoughtfulness, it’ll be a bit before a conduit is constructed by them that will be able to handle your full power. <br />

<span style="font-size: 0.938rem"><br />
<b>[X] Glyph Workshop</b>: You’ve seen the wonders of what man can do when he starts making Glyphs and Runes. What you need is a building meant to train people in the same art, thankfully you have your own teacher in this regard. There’s no point in your discovery of the mysteries of the higher echelons of runes and glyphs if you don’t have the people to make use of the advances. Cost: 75. Upkeep: 25 Time: 1 Years. Chance of Success: 100% Reward: Rune template, enhances troops.<br />
<br />
Roll: 45: Success<br />
<br />
The rest of this goes off without a hitch with Barnes now the head scribe of a hundred other scribes and ten lieutenant scribes. For now they’re working in a construction that’s meant to eventually have machines doing most of their work for them, so it’s understandably spacious. Anyway the first thing that’s done is have all the uniforms on the base done… uniformly in terms of rune arrays. Though haphazardly done according to the book by your soldiers since you’ve acquired the runes, effectively as well, the designs implemented by your new scribes allow for them to extract as much protection as possible from the same runes.<br />

[You are currently Injured (-2 Martial) this trait will be gone by the end of the year.]<br />
<br />
The current situation is… rather grave.<br />
<br />
In Russia, they are mounting a massive counter-offensive with demi-humans supported by as much armor that can be brought to bear. Still, it’s only a stopgap measure as even though the giant chimera are being driven off and wounded, they aren’t being killed. The beasts are very intelligent and very knowledgeable of their finite numbers, thus they are willing to take wounds in order to make sure they all stay alive. The situation can only stand for another year before the demi-humans will have their entire force injured or otherwise unable to battle and then be replaced by human soldiers, which would only result in massacres. They need help, and has requested you to locate a pack of six chimeric beasts that are ferrying around the child-beasts and several eggs. Then, the group will be nuked.<br />
<br />
Over in Europe the Church is being a bunch of idiots, but the Templars simply cannot destroy their Seven Holy Swords. The blades are still needed in order to properly destroy the enemy currently haranguing them at their base. Their request from you is simpler: delay the armada by a year. No small feat considering the magical nature of the ships and the experienced men and women that compromise the Knights Hospitaller. However, you do have the advantage of having a very, very good possible distraction on your side that is already aligned with the Templars and ought to be able to give your men enough time to devastate the fleet.<br />
<br />
Congress has approved a larger budget for your two groups, but most of the increase will be going to CSG for the sole reason that the man is currently fighting a war on American soil. Much to your surprise, he’s the only ally of yours that doesn’t outright need your help. The man’s refurbished a few cargo-planes into slapdash gunships and acquired a few jet fighters to field for his fight.  Of course, the man himself didn’t tell you this, but rather his wife Maria Arce did. The woman is from South America and is quite attractive, but is more cunning than a snake. You’re better, of course, but the woman’s going to make it a lot harder for you to manipulate her husband. All for the better really, because if a matter of manipulation is difficult for you, it’ll be nigh-impossible for others.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Major Steinberg will require most of the manpower for his campaign, leaving you with less-skilled special forces to pick from. What a tragedy.<br />
</span><br />
<b><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">Federal Income: 300, Units Bought This Turn Will Be at Experienced: +1 to All Stats.</span></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 0.938rem"><br />
Also you’ve realized that you can blow away a main battle tank in less than five seconds, a bit scary considering you still can’t handle yourself in a fistfight.<br />
</span><br />
<b><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">770 Income Available</span></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 0.938rem"><br />
<br />
<b><u>Learning</u></b>: Rachel Timothy is slowly getting sucked into her work. There are very few people capable of doggedly pursuing a single subject, but apparently Miss Timothy is one of them. You get her to relax many times over, usually over some cake. The scientist has quite the sweet tooth. <b>(Choose 1)</b><br />
<br />
<b>[] Stealth Weapons Platforms</b>: This is a new breed of vehicles, not just a single vehicle. You need to look into quiet engines, different technologies, and methods to make the most of your advanced technology. You can’t simply use the loud machines that the army is currently using forever. They need to be quick, quiet, and inconspicuous. Essentially you and Timothy will be making a ‘family’ of vehicles that work considering your current doctrines. Cost: 360. Upkeep: 160 Time: 2 Years. Chance of Success 70% Reward: Stealth Vehicles, Better transportation, quicker pursuit, heavy weapons. +10 to Espionage Actions after completion. <br />
<br />
<b>[] Computers and Transmitters: </b>These two are your main money makers, with both of them giving you immense amounts of money. Staying ahead of competitors, however, requires you to work on this by putting equally ludicrous amounts of money into your computers. You figure that having a computer that can act as a transmitter, and coordinate with other computers will be quite a boon for your work! Thankfully, you and Timothy are so well versed in this subject that developing the massive project will take just under a year given the fact you’ve made sure the base technology can be rapidly upgraded. Cost: 180 Upkeep: 80 Chance of Success 80%  Time: 1 Year. Reward: Basic Wireless Computer Networks. +10 Research Bonus. +200 Research Income on completion minimum.<br />
<br />
<b>[] Woden’s Blood</b>: The computational requirements of this recipe is enormous, the mathematical equations well beyond that of any computer you currently have despite the fact you’re continuously funneling money into making each generation of computer better than the next. However, you have decrypted the initial sample and have found it to be a ludicrously poisonous  substance against those with much magic in their blood. The odor of the sample alone made you bedridden, while Timothy hardly got a headache. Anyway, pursuing this will need you to make a specialized computer as well as facilities capable of producing it. Cost: 80. Upkeep 20. Time: 1 year. Chance of Success 100% Reward: Slayer Bullets (Adds to Squad Cost: +5), Improved Attack against Foes with high Piety (Magic) (Minimum +5 Attack, Stronger against more magical opponents) High Interest by Federal Government.<br />
<br />
[X] Improved Body Armor: Given the fact that Rune Armor is proving to simply be better than any modern armor available, the government wants you in on the development of the new generation of body armor. It’s no small secret that all your innovations are generally being adopted by the US military, but this monumental program is the first sign they’re truly not considering you lightly. Cost: 150. Upkeep:0 (Federal Program, Won’t Require any money for you to Upkeep). Time: 2 Years. Chance of Success 90% Reward: Enhanced Infantry Armor (Adds to Squad Cost), Improved Defense (Minimum 1, Maximum 3) +150 Research Income on completion<br />
</span><br />
<b><span style="font-size: 0.938rem">-Finishes This Year.</span></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 0.938rem"><br />
<b><u>Personal</u></b>: Alright, a year without meditation seemingly hasn’t killed you, nor has rendered you a hedonistic sociopath. That’s a good thing, though you are having odd thoughts concerning marrying several women… at the same time. Well, best nip that in the bud. <b>(Choose 2)</b><br />
<br />
<b>[] Meditation:</b> It’s allowed you a great deal of level-headed-ness and composure, you actively wonder why no one else does it. Cost: 0 Upkeep:0 Time 1 Year. Chance of Success: 100% Reward:  70 or Greater: Lose Foolish Trait. 80 or Greater: Gain More Piety.<br />
<br />
<b>[] Family Ties:</b>  The US government has informed you they have found another person that shares your family. A woman who was divorced from your family a few generations ago gave birth to a child, and that child another. A long-lost cousin as it were, just a few years apart from you lives on… and is being hunted. There is something stalking him, watching him, and is killing those close to him. Find it. Kill it. Cost: 1 Agent Squad, You. Upkeep:0 Time 1 Year. Chance of Success: 80%  Reward: ???, Save Cousin living his normal life.<br />
<br />
<b>[] Dark Days:</b> You’re flimsy when it comes to a fight, you need to work on that. Elena Heart agrees and disapproves of this greatly. While you’d like to say that your wounds will keep you from being forced through an intense boot camp, that is not the case. Whatever the vampire hunter plans on doing, has been cleared by your physician (the traitor!) and will make you more capable in combat… oh joy. Cost: 0 Upkeep:0 Time 1 Year. Chance of Success: 90% Reward: Closer to Elena Heart. Get Either Hunter of The Dark, or Keeper of The House above 50. Above 80, get one trait and +1 Piety.<br />
<br />
<b>[] Union: </b>Getting married is a must, as a tool alone it can allow you to establish ties with other nations. You’re not going to lie to yourself, having another person to aid you with your burdens at your side will aid you greatly. You’ll even understand if they don’t wish for children, there are… other means of doing such a thing. You’ll accommodate them as best as you are able… Cost: 0. Upkeep: 0 Chance of Success: 100% Reward: Marriage Candidates. </span></div>
